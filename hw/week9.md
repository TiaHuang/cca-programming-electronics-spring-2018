### Practice Quiz

On Monday, April 9th, we'll have an in-class paper exam. This upcoming Monday, April 2cd, we'll review this practice quiz. Please try to complete it before then -- the practice quiz is one of the most useful things you can do for your grade in this class.

Here's [the practice quiz itself](practice-quiz.pdf).

Instructions:

- The in-class examination will be open-book, open-notes, but closed-computer. (No digital devices will be allowed.) The format will be very similar to this practice quiz.

- To complete the practice quiz, take as long as you need (but be aware that we'll give you 2 hours in class), see what you can do without your computer, and use whatever notes you plan to bring. This is also a good opportunity for you to flesh out your notes if you're missing anything.

### Final Project 

Look over the [final project proposal template](project-template.md) and [sample proposal](sample-proposal.md).  Start thinking about what you want to do, and write down an idea (just the title and summary part of the proposal).   You can change your mind later if you need to, this is just to get you started.  

### Submit this homework to me by email by Sunday night, 11:59pm on April 1st.

- Scan (or photograph with your cell phone) your completed practice quiz.
- Put the title and summary of your final project proposal draft into the body of the email.
- Please [email both items to me](mailto:cantor@cca.edu) in a single email.
- Don't worry about the homework submission form for this homework.
